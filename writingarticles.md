## Narrative Essay

A narrative essay tells a story, often from the author's perspective, incorporating characters, a setting, and a plot. It is the most effective essay type to write on Medium because of its relational nature.

Purpose:

To engage the reader emotionally and convey a specific experience or insight. It often includes a lesson learned or a personal reflection.

## Persuasive Essay

A persuasive essay aims to persuade the reader to adopt a particular viewpoint or take a specific action by presenting compelling arguments and supporting evidence.

Purpose:

To influence the reader's beliefs or behaviours, addressing opposing views and emphasizing the validity of the author's position.

## Process Essay

A process essay explains how to do something or how a process works. It provides a step-by-step guide, often in chronological order.

Think:

“How to…”

“7 Steps to…”

“The Ultimate Guide to…”

Purpose:

To inform and instruct the reader on a specific procedure or process. It breaks down complex tasks into manageable steps for clarity.
